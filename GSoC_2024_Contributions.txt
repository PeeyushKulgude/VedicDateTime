Introduction
The VedicDateTime package has undergone a significant revision to enhance its functionality, accuracy, and usability. The updates align with the project's goal of providing a comprehensive tool for working with the Vedic calendar system, supporting multiple calendar systems, and advanced date and time calculations. This document details all the changes made to the package, ensuring that users are aware of the new features, improvements, and added capabilities.

Key Updates and Enhancements
1. Support for Additional Calendar Systems
Sayana Calendar System:
Introduced a new function convert_to_vedic_sayana(date) that allows users to convert Gregorian dates to the Sayana calendar system. The function accurately handles the unique aspects of this system.
Drik Siddhanta Calendar System:
Added convert_to_vedic_drik(date), a function that enables conversions between Gregorian dates and the Drik Siddhanta calendar. This addition provides users with more flexibility in their work with Vedic dates.

2. Advanced Date and Time Calculations
Tithi Calculation:
Implemented calculate_tithi(date) to accurately compute the tithi (lunar day) for any given date and time. The calculation is based on the angular difference between the Sun and Moon's positions.
Nakshatra Calculation:
Developed calculate_nakshatra(date), a function to determine the nakshatra (star constellation) based on the Moon's position. This feature is crucial for detailed Vedic time analysis.
Moon Phases:
Introduced find_next_full_moon(date) and find_next_new_moon(date) functions. These functions allow users to calculate the dates of the next full moon or new moon from any starting date.

3. Improved Accuracy
Refinement of Conversion Algorithms:
Updated the algorithms used in convert_to_vedic_surya(date), convert_to_vedic_sayana(date), and convert_to_vedic_drik(date) to ensure higher accuracy. These improvements include more precise calculations of solar and lunar positions, better handling of leap years, and time zone adjustments.
Data Validation and Updates:
Verified and updated the data vectors for masas, tithis, nakshatras, ritus, and other Vedic calendar elements. This ensures that the package adheres to the most accurate definitions and standards available.

5. Customization and Flexibility
Custom Epochs:
Added support for custom epochs, allowing users to define starting points for calculations that accommodate regional or traditional variants of the Vedic calendar.
Time Zone Adjustments:
Introduced functionality to account for time zones in date and time calculations, making the package more versatile for users worldwide.
Locale Support:
Began preparations for offering translations of calendar elements into regional languages and scripts, which will broaden the package's accessibility.

6. Performance and Scalability
Parallel Processing:
Implemented parallel processing for computationally intensive tasks, such as calculating tithis or nakshatras over large date ranges. This enhancement significantly improves the package's performance, especially when working with extensive datasets.
Caching Mechanism:
Added a caching mechanism to store results of commonly requested calculations. This reduces processing time for repeated queries and enhances user experience.

7. Documentation and Examples
Expanded Documentation:
Thoroughly updated the documentation to cover all new functions, calendar systems, and calculations. Detailed examples are provided to guide users through the package's advanced features.
Tutorials and Vignettes:
Developed new tutorials and vignettes that showcase the package’s capabilities in real-world scenarios. These resources are designed to help users maximize the potential of the VedicDateTime package.

8. Testing and Quality Assurance
Comprehensive Testing Suite:
Expanded the test suite to include a wide range of edge cases, rare scenarios, and performance benchmarks. This ensures that the package is both accurate and efficient.
Cross-Validation:
Cross-validated the package’s output against authoritative sources and other well-established Vedic calendar software to ensure the highest level of accuracy.

9. Versioning and Release Notes
Version 1.0.0:
The package version has been updated to 1.0.0 to reflect the significant enhancements and new features. Detailed release notes have been prepared, outlining all the changes and improvements made.
