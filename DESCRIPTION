Description: The VedicDateTime package provides a comprehensive platform for 
    working with the Vedic calendar system, supporting conversions between 
    Gregorian and multiple Vedic calendar systems (Surya Siddhanta, Sayana, 
    and Drik Siddhanta). The package includes advanced functionalities for 
    calculating tithis, nakshatras, moon phases, and other important Vedic 
    time elements. It is designed to facilitate high-precision analysis and 
    integration with time series data. Recent updates improve accuracy, 
    support for additional calendar systems, and advanced date/time calculations. 
    A Shiny dashboard is also available for interactive exploration of Vedic dates.
